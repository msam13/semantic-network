Knowledge representation is an emerging field of
research in Artificial Intelligence, Big data analytics, Semantic
web, and Data Mining. Knowledge represented in an effective way
helps in easy traversal, searching, reasoning, prediction, and
inference. There are number of approaches, algorithms,
techniques, and models that have been proposed for the same.
Every approach has their own pros and cons. Hence our aim is to
propose a simple and extremely effective way to represent
knowledge, which has a greater expressiveness compared to logic
and reverberates within the methods of people process data. In this
paper we address the implementation of semantics network with
simple yet powerful method, which despite the vague nature of
English language, proves to give accurate results. The patterns
discovered in sentences are listed in a defined order throughout
the paper. The usage of Natural Language Toolkit and Posing
tagging simplifies the most crucial task of tagging a word with its
part of speech.
